# Welcome to the Predictor for burned areas by forest fires

## Overview

The target is to predict burned areas using a regression model.

We'll use the Forest Fires Dataset (Indices from the Fire Weather Index System: Drought Code DC, Duff Moisture Code DMC and Fine Fuel Moisture Code FFMC)

by Christian Ramirez

## Tasks included:

1.-Analyze and understand the provided dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis.

2.-Determine the insight you want to address with a machine learning model.

3.-Identify why an MLOps strategy is needed for this dataset. (Module 1)

4.-Design the pipeline architecture for this new machine learning initiative.

5.-Create a baseline model to address prediction tasks (classification, regression, etc.) related to the question. This model does not need high accuracy, recall, or F1 score; the goal is to create a quick model for iteration. (Module 4)
